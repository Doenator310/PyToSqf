This Program converts python pseudocode to .SQF Files that can be executed by 
arma3

Requires Python3.9+

Not Done and Not Perfect
its just a proof of concept with a lot of noodle code
Made in 1 Day..

Be careful if you want to use it, this is really just a prototype of an idea that I had while I was frustrated with sqf.

Python tuples are not fully supported

If you make something based on this just credit me pls :D
